    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me – Richard Hayes</h2>
        <p>I'm just a good ol' boy from Monroe, GA, who's spent the last 30+ years turnin' houses into homes folks love comin' back to. Started out helpin' my daddy with odd jobs around the farm, and before long, I was masterin' trades left and right – plumbin', electrical, carpentry, paintin', you name it. These days, all my work comes from happy customers tellin' their friends, and I stay busier than a one-armed paperhanger. But hey, if you're lookin' for someone reliable who shows up on time and cleans up after, that's me. I only work within 20 miles of Monroe so I can give y'all the personal touch you deserve.</p>

        <h2>What I Can Fix or Fancy Up for Ya</h2>
        <p>I handle just about anything around the house or yard. Here's a taste of what I do best:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kitchen and Bathroom Remodels – Turn that outdated space into somethin' straight out of a magazine, without breakin' the bank.</li>
            <li>Plumbin' Fixes – From drippin' faucets to full pipe replacements, I'll stop those leaks cold.</li>
            <li>Electrical Work – Lightin', outlets, fans – safe and sound, no shocks guaranteed.</li>
            <li>Carpentry and Drywall – Buildin' shelves, fixin' holes, or craftin' custom pieces.</li>
            <li>Paintin' and Stainin' – Inside or out, I'll make it look fresh as a daisy.</li>
            <li>Deck and Fence Buildin' – Sturdy stuff that'll last through Georgia storms.</li>
            <li>General Handyman Stuff – Hangin' pictures, assemblin' furniture, or whatever's got you stumped.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If it ain't on the list, just ask – chances are I've done it a hundred times.</p>
